# custom-react-cli
My Custom React CLI is a command-line interface tool that you use to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain React applications. You can use the tool directly in a command shell.

## Installing Angular CLI
Install the CLI using the npm package manager:

    npm install -g custom-react-cli
